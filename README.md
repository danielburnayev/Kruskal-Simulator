## How to run the simulator:
1. Download the [src.zip file](src.zip) and open it
2. Open your terminal and direct it to the newly created src directory
3. Compile all the Java files with the following command: javac -cp 310libs.jar *.java (shouldn't be necessary; only do this when all the class files aren't there)
4. Run the simulator with following command: java -cp .:310libs.jar SimGUI (do java -cp .;310libs.jar SimGUI for Windows systems)
